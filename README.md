# Kitchen Door Piece Replacement

## Problem

The kitchen door at the Buinho FabLab hadn't been installed properly - the door is shorter than the frame - leaving too much space both on top and below. This prevents the door from closing properly.

The right door top locking piece was damaged from improper use and needed replacement.

## Solution

To solve the problem, two possible solutions were identified:
1. Either raise the door (which had been attempted before), or lower it to get it closer to either the top or bottom locks;
2. Replace the damaged top locking piece, changing it's design to lock the door in place when the handle is rotated to the lock position.

After some consideration, the second solution was implemented, consisting on fabricating a newly designed top locking piece.

3D printing was the fabrication methodology chosen to produce the new piece.

The first step was to digitally recreate the original piece by measuring it with a caliper meter.

After testing different iterations, a few modifications were made to the original design. Specifically, the side pointing inwards needed to be lower in order to hold the door lock in place and avoid it damaging the new piece, has had happened to the original.
